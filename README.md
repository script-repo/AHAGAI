The AHAGAI project is a method for rapid learning and integration of new information. It stands for Accelerated Habit Adoption with Generation Artificial Intelligence.

**The Approach:**

1. Read every book on self improvement, learning, and synthesizing information

2. Read every book and case-study on efficiency

3. Integrate all known philosophical methods for self betterment
